# DESIGN-TOOL-WORKSHOP--miniproject
circuit design of fire-alarm system based on object detection using Arduino temperature sensor, 
with DIM light capability. In this scenario, the buzzer blows only with the detection of fire accident otherwise
the lights will remain OFF at rest of the time, and DIM at night-time. It can be used to promote security in urban areas and to increase 
the quality of life by artificially extending the hours in which it is light so that activity can take place.
